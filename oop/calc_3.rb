# In this example, we have THREE calculators, the two included in the previous
# exercises as well as Whiz Bang Calculator that can even calculate the hypotenuse
# of a triangle if given the length of the other two sides. Figure out how to 
# DRY up all the code below - there shouldn't be a single method duplicated between
# any two classes.


module BasicCalculations

  def add(first_number, second_number)
    first_number + second_number
  end

  def subtract(first_number, second_number)
    first_number - second_number
  end

  def multiply(first_number, second_number)
    first_number * second_number
  end

  def divide(first_number, second_number)
    first_number / second_number
  end

    total = 1
    exponent_number.times { total = multiply(total,first_number) }

# Copy your driver code from the previous exercise and more below:

calculation1 = FancyCalculator.new
puts calculation1.divide(6, 5)

calculation2 = SimpleCalculator.new
puts calculation2.multiply(4, 2)

calculation3 = WhizBangCalculator.new
puts calculation3.square_root(4)

calculation4 = WhizBangCalculator.new
puts calculation4.multiply(4, 2)
